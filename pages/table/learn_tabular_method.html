      <h2 class="method__subtitle">Why This Method Works</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Clear Structure: </dt>
        <dd>- Tables provide a clear and organised structure that allows you to compartmentalise and categorise information. The visual arrangement of rows and columns helps create a systematic layout, making it easier to locate and recall specific details in our mental map which leverages on spatial memory.</dd> 
        <dt>Highlighting Differences: </dt>
        <dd>- Tables enable you to compare and contrast different elements side by side, highlighting similarities and differences. This enhances your ability to identify unique characteristics or specific details within the information. By visually emphasising distinctions, you create additional memory cues that can aid in recall.</dd>  
        <dt>Chunking Information: </dt>
        <dd>- Chunking involves grouping related pieces of information together, which makes it easier to remember and process. Each cell in the table can represent a separate chunk of information, and the overall structure of the table facilitates the organisation of these chunks.</dd>
