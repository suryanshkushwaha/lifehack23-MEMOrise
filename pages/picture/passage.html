                    <h2 class="method__subtitle">Why This Method Works</h2>
                    <dl>
                      <dt>Visual and Spatial Memory: </dt>
                      <dd>- The human brain is highly adept at processing and remembering visual information. We are naturally inclined to remember images more vividly and for a longer duration compared to textual information. Images engage our visual and spatial memory systems, which are known to be highly efficient and effective for memory recall.</dd> 
                      <dt>Dual Coding: </dt>
                      <dd>- The picture method utilises both visual and verbal coding, as you are creating images to represent textual information. The combination of visual and verbal elements provides multiple pathways for accessing the stored information.</dd>
                    </dl>
