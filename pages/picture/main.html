            Mary woke up late today but she had a long list of tasks to do for the day. She had to bring her dog, Rudd, to the vet, go shopping and then meet her friend, Sally. Her dog was feeling scared of the vet so Mary had to pretend they were going to the dog park. She brought over Ruddâ€™s favourite stuffed toy, the mouse called Sam. Rudd never leaves anywhere without it. They went by car so they reached the vet in five minutes. Unfortunately, Rudd had ticks.
            Then Mary had to buy a mango, a toothbrush and a T-shirt at the nearest supermarket to her house. She rushed in, took a basket, found her items and paid for them all. She was able to meet her friend on time. They had lunch, watched a movie and finally settled down for dinner. Three other girls joined them at night for a sleepover. They spent the entire night talking about movies and food. Overall, Mary had a wonderful day.
