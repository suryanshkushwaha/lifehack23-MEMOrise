      <p class="method__passage-content">
        Mary and John are very good friends in college. Mary is studying to
        become a marine ecologist while John is studying meteorology. They met
        in common classes such as "climate change as pre-mass extinction" and
        "the ethics of conservation". They enjoy spending their time hiking,
        John likes to climb mountains. They volunteer regularly. While John does
        monthly cleanups at an animal shelter, Mary volunteers weekly at an old folks
        home curating plants for the elderly. When they graduate, John wants to
        climb mount-everest while Mary wants to spend time studying corals and
        how farmers can utilise modern technology to improve the sustainability
        of coral-farming.

      <h2 class="method__subtitle">Why This Method Works</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Visual Distinction:</dt>
        <dd>
          - Highlighting important or key words/phrases in a text creates a
          visual distinction that draws attention. When studying or reviewing
          the material, the highlighted text stands out, making it easier to
          recognize and remember the crucial information.
        </dd>
        <dt>Focus and Organization:</dt>
        <dd>
          - By selectively highlighting specific words or phrases, you can
          emphasize the most relevant information within a text. This process
          helps you focus on the essential concepts and creates a visual
          organization that aids in understanding and memorization.
        </dd>
        <dt>Retrieval Practice:</dt>
        <dd>
          - The act of highlighting involves active engagement with the
          material. When you read through the text and decide which parts to
          highlight, you are actively processing and evaluating the information.
          This process of retrieval practice strengthens memory recall and
          retention.

      <h2 class="method__subtitle">Tips to Implement This Method</h2>
      <p>
        Main Ideas: Highlight the main ideas or central concepts of the text.
        These are the key takeaways or overarching themes that the author is
        conveying. <br /><hr>
        Supporting Details: Highlight supporting details that provide evidence,
        examples, or explanations for the main ideas. These details help
        reinforce and illustrate the main points. <br /><hr>
        Definitions and Terminology: Highlight important definitions, technical
        terms, or vocabulary that are critical to understanding the subject
        matter. <br /><hr>
        Key Phrases or Keywords: Highlight specific phrases or keywords that
        encapsulate important information or serve as cues for recall. <br /><hr>
        Headings or Subheadings: If applicable, highlight headings or
        subheadings that provide a structural outline of the content. These can
        help in organizing the information mentally.
